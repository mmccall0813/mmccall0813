# Hello!

Coding is a hobby of mine and you can find some of my projects here. You can also find some of my projects on my [Glitch profile](https://glitch.com/@mmccall0813).
I mainly write code in Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I know a litlle bit of C++ but I havent wrote anything in it yet.

A few of the things I've made:
 - [Fated Forest](https://fated-forest-rpg.glitch.me/)
    - A simple turn based combat game
    - Coded from scratch
 - [Agar.io Clone](https://agariok.glitch.me)
    - Built on top of [Cigar2](https://github.com/Cigar2/Cigar2) and [MultiOgar-Edited](https://github.com/Luka967/MultiOgar-Edited)
    - I've added a few custom chat commands
