# Hello!

Coding is a hobby of mine and you can find some of my projects here. You can also find some of my projects on my [Glitch profile](https://glitch.com/@mmccall0813).
I mainly write code in Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I know a litlle bit of C++ but I havent wrote anything in it yet. I like to build apps like discord bots and games.

I mainly use Visual Studio Code to write code.
